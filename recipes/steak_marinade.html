    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a family recipe that has been developed only over the last 5 years. In this short time it's made me
        famous in our close circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce
        </li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil
        </li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
        </li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons garlic powder
        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dried basil
        </li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons dried parsley flakes
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper
        </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon hot pepper sauce (Optional)
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried minced garlic (Optional)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, basil, parsley, and pepper
            in a blender. Add hot pepper sauce and garlic, if desired. Blend on high speed for 30 seconds until
            thoroughly mixed.

        </li>
        <li>Pour marinade over desired type of meat. Cover, and refrigerate for up to 8 hours. Cook meat as desired.
